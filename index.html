	<p>Our latest Project: </p>
		<img src="smartify.png">
	<p>Proposal:</p>
	<p>Ever since the introduction of the first smartphone our daily lives have been changed in a way we would never have imagined. Not only was this a new paradigm but with the help of the internet and the rise of users brought communication, productivity and convenience to new extremes. Our company, The Millenials, has been focusing closely with these extremes and is pleased to introduce "Smartify" to our project base. <i>The tinder for finding the right study buddy!</i> Users can search for nearby classmates and filter through several categories after inputting their class and institution. Our website platform uses states of the art searching algorithms and provides real-time updates as to how long the partner wishes to study and if they have moved locations. For more information please contact Ajwad Ishaque our Project Manager. </p>
  
  
	<p><i>*This is created and maintained by a group called "THE MILLENIALS", as a project in course 06-205 of University of Windsor under the professor Dr. Lili Saghafi.</i></p>
